This was a project done for my Software Engineering and Design course. The two main components are the choice to generate a new wordbank which pulls and filters five letter words from (www.gutenburg.org).
From there the user can then play a full re-make of the popular game wordle. 

To run the program navigate the path to: csci205_hw-main/src/main/java/Wordle/Main.java
